# 01-Code-Refactor
Refactor Code to meet acceptance criteria.

## Description

I was motivated by wanting to learn how to organize and declutter code to be as efficient as possible. Taking the starter code and making it as clean and organized has helped me practice so that when I am creating my own page, I can follow a similar structure and always use the best practice. The problems refactoring solves are organization and efficiency with the code sheets. That way any future team members working on same project will have no issues locating what they are looking for. I learned how important it is to stay organized when coding. Any projects that are disorganized can easily become a huge mess that may cause many errors in the future.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
